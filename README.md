  * For over 15 years, Weygandt, Accounting Principles has been praised by both instructors and students across the country for its outstanding visual design, its carefully integrated pedagogy, and its excellent writing style and clarity of presentation. Our main focus continues to be ‘Student Success in Accounting’ and the new seventh edition package further enables both instructors and students to achieve successful learning outcomes. With this edition, we have added two new authors, Valerie Warren and Lori Novak.  They bring fresh new ideas, updates, and continue to implement challenging accounting concepts through examples that are familiar to the student with a stepped-out pedagogy that breaks down complex topics making the material more manageable. This connection to their everyday lives helps build student motivation, a key driver of student time spent on assignments and ultimately their mastery of the concepts.
